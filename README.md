**PERIPHERAL**

This folder contains the Arduino peripheral code (PERIPHERAL.ino) compatible for Arduino Nano 33 IoT. Main functions include capacitive sensor and LED control, IMU data recording and wireless BLE communication with central device.

**CENTRAL**

This folder contains the Arduino central code (CENTRAL.ino) compatible for Arduino Nano 33 IoT. Main functions include buzzer control, IMU data processing to calculate orientation and wirerless BLE communication with peripheral device. IoT should be connected to a computer/laptop for serial communication with Processing.

**ANIMATION**

This folder contains the Processing code (ANIMATION.pde) and graphics for GUI. Main functions include an interactive GUI, animation of hand orientation and exporting data as hcard.csv file.

Have fun!:)
